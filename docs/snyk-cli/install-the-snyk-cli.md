## Install the Snyk CLI with npm or Yarn

Before installing the Snyk CLI using npm, be sure you have installed the **prerequisites**:

* Install the latest version of npm in your local environment, using Node version 12 or later. See [What version of Node is required for Snyk?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004183317-What-version-of-Node-is-required-for-Snyk-) for the steps to update Node.
* To run Snyk on Alpine Linux, first install libstdc++. See [How can I use CLI on an Alpine operating system?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001929038) for more information.

Then follow these **steps to install with npm or Yarn**:

[Snyk CLI is available as an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snyk). If you have Node.js installed locally, you can **install** the npm package by running `npm install snyk -g`.

If you are using Yarn, **install** by running `yarn global add snyk`.

## Install with standalone executables

Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases) to download a standalone executable (macOS, Linux, Windows) of Snyk CLI for your platform.

Snyk also provides these standalone executables on the Snyk Content Delivery Network (CDN). See [https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json](https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json) for the download links. Examples for a specific version or platform follow:

* [https://static.snyk.io/cli/v1.666.0/release.json](https://static.snyk.io/cli/v1.666.0/release.json)
* [https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos](https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos)

For example, to download and run the latest Snyk CLI on macOS, you could run:

```bash
curl https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos -o snyk
chmod +x ./snyk
mv ./snyk /usr/local/bin/
```

You can also use these direct links to download the executables:

## Snyk CLI in a Docker image

Snyk CLI can also be run from a Docker image. Snyk offers multiple Docker images under [snyk/snyk-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli) and [snyk/snyk](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) (see [snyk/snyk-images on GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images) for more details).

These images wrap the Snyk CLI and depending on the Tag come with relevant tooling for different projects, for example, for scanning a Gradle project with snyk/snyk-cli:

```bash
docker run -it
    -e "SNYK_TOKEN=<TOKEN>"
