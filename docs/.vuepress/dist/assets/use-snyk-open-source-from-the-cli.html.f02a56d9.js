Based on the analysis, Snyk creates a hierarchical tree of the structure represented in the manifest file: both its direct and indirect (transitive) dependencies and the points at which the different packages are introduced. Once the tree has been built, Snyk uses its vulnerability database to find vulnerabilities in any of the packages anywhere in the dependency tree. Using Snyk makes it easier to analyze the project than fixing the project from its source. You can quickly identify the point at which any given vulnerable package was introduced.</p>',5),u=e("When "),f=t("code",null,"snyk test",-1),m=e(" runs, it tries to autodetect your project type by looking for the following files and analyzing the first of the files that it finds.
